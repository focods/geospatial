Exploration of Geo-spatial concepts

Operations on shapefiles using geopandas, plotting shapefiles with annotation and creation of a heatmap using Colorado Oil Well production data for the year 2017.

## OilAndGasMap.ipynb

Python notebook illustrating the use of geopandas and shapely libraries 
to draw maps and explore geospatial concepts.  The notebook shows how to read a shapefile and plot it,
plot arbitrary points on a map, create a map with layers and produce a heat map.  The notebook uses real data
from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission to show the position of 2017 crude oil production relative
to Coloradoâ€™s population centers.

The notebook references shapefiles and oil well production data.
These data items are supplied in the `data.zip` file in the repo.
Download this file and unzip it to directory in which you'll run the notebook.
Unzip will create the `data` directory that the notebook requires.
The shapefiles are from the US Census Bureau and
[Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov/Municipal/Municipal-Boundaries-in-Colorado/u943-ics6/data)
Oil well production data is from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.
